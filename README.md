### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I'm Ä°brahim, a software developer, Front-End Developer and system administrator.

    In the past years, I wrote database queries to ERP programs with SQL and worked as an expert in Nebim V3 ERP program. In addition, I gained experience as a system administrator, reporting specialist and social media manager in the textile industry.

    I am knowledgeable in HTML and CSS and am currently learning JavaScript and React. You can find projects related to these languages on my GitHub profile.

    Here, I share my experience in software development, system administration and reporting. I hope to work together on great projects.

Thank you for browsing my GitHub profile. If you have any questions or offers of cooperation, please do not hesitate to contact me. See you later
